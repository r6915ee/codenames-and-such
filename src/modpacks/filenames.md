# Filenames

Do note that **filenames are important for cross-compatibility**. Specifically,
you should prefer lowercase.

The reason is that platforms like Linux have case-sensitive filenames. This
makes it so that they will not work well natively.

In general, a good way to test your mod for cross-compatibility is to have
playtesters on various platforms, to see how it performs and to look for
oddities.

Use the console to look for filename errors, and correct them as usual.
