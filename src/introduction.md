# Introduction

**Codenames and Such** is an unofficial book that details additional
content for [Codename Engine](https://codename-engine.com/), a fangame engine
for [Friday Night Funkin'](https://funkin.me/) with a focus on softcoding,
modding, and optimizations. The official wiki can be found
[here](https://codename-engine.com/wiki/), for most cases.

The engine in question is the successor to a prior one, titled **Yoshi
Engine**. However, that engine is considered outdated. Codename
improves upon what Yoshi Engine did by allowing source code mods,
using Haxe packages for organization, and being much more friendly in general.

This book details information not present in the current wiki, but is
more intended for tips and tricks, as well as providing decisions based
on circumstances. It's also meant to be more of a guide.
